# pancake-sniper-crypto-LIGHT
Most snipers nowadays are either too complicated and the code is too hard to follow.

This sniper does only 1 thing, it buys the token that you are prompted to enter when launched.

You configure how much you wanna ape, slippage is ignored, we are apes, aren't we?

It uses the swapExactETHForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens method from Pancakeswap's V2 Router, nothing more, nothing else.

Requirements:
- Node
- Basic understanding of what is an address and what a private key is


Configuration:
0. Run `npm install`
1. Replace values in `.env` file with your own, otherwise, how would you be ape-ing?
2. Run `node buy.js` or `npm run start`, you will be prompted to enter the token address you wish to buy

![Alt text](token.png?raw=true "Token")

Method used:
![Alt text](swap.png?raw=true "Swap")


Notes:
- Your private key is secure, never share it with anyone, don't be stupid

Warnings:
- Ape responsibly
- This script buys the token, ignores any slippage thus making sure you get it, at what price?
- Degen slippage, you pretty much ignore everything slippage related and JUST APE like a Degen

p.s. From a degen for a degen with love

If you made profit and you are willing to share it with me, send a bean (or less) for me for a beer.
